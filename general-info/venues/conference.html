        <p>The Michigan League is located at 911 North University Ave and accessible through the main North University Ave building entrance. There is also an entrance off Ingalls Mall on the west side of the building that requires using stairs. A third entrance on the north side of the building has a ramp and door opener, but is not considered accessible.</p>

        <h3>Navigating the building</h3>
        <p>Conference events — including the registration table and a <a href="/general-info/accessibility#quietroom">Quiet Room</a> — will all be on <b>floor 2</b>. We have a single room reserved on floor 1 for use by the Community Support Squad if private conversations are needed.</p>
        <p>There is a wheelchair accessible elevator in the center of the building. After entering through the main entrance, proceed straight down the corridor. About halfway down, you’ll find the elevator on the right after passing the lobby and central stairs. Get to floor 2 via stairs using the front stairwell after entering the building or the central stairwell in the middle. </p>
        <p>Restrooms are available on each floor. There is a single-stall restroom on floor 3 labeled as a family restroom that’s available to all. The Spectrum Center also maintains <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X5JC6fxtx3XLMrliL6WS4_NT4g67A5fVfg6jVV5idsE/edit?usp=sharing">a list of gender inclusive restrooms on campus</a>.</p>
        <p>We will provide a League floor plan here noting where events will be held once room assignments are finalized. We will have physical copies available at the registration desk as well. </p>
