            <p>
				During the general conference, Code4Lib {{site.data.conf.year}} will feature live captioning by {{site.data.conf.live-captioning.service}}. In order to improve the quality of this service, we ask everyone to speak slowly and clearly so the captioning service is able to accurately capture what you say. Any prerecorded sessions or talks will also be live captioned.
				{% if site.data.conf.closed-captioning.show %}
					Attendees, both local and remote, may view the text stream at:
               		<a href="{{site.data.conf.closed-captioning.url}}">{{site.data.conf.closed-captioning.url}}</a>.
				{% endif %}
				These transcriptions will be applied to the captioning on the YouTube archive soon after the completion of the conference.

            <p>
				For the General Conference days, the {{site.data.conf.quiet-room.location}} will serve as a <em>quiet room</em> at the conference venue. The purpose of this room is to provide a quiet space so that attendees can take a mental or physical break from the many goings on. The room is open to all attendees during the conference hours.
            </p>
            <p>
               If you use the Quiet Room, we ask you to abide by the following rules:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>The quiet space is not for private discussions or meetings. Any talking should be brief and kept to a whisper.</li>
               <li>While in the room, please turn off or silence any electronics, especially cellphones. This is not a space to make phone calls, catch up on emails, or otherwise do work. This is a space to relax.
               </li>
               <li>If you want to listen to music, watch a video, etc., please wear headphones and keep the volume low. If someone asks you to further turn down the volume, please do so.</li>
               <li>Personal belongings should not be left unattended.</li>
               <li>Please leave the space in the same condition (or better) as you found it.</li>
               <li>Food and drink is permitted but avoid noisy foods or anything with strong odors. </li>
               <li>We will attempt to generally keep the lights as low as possible while maintaining a safe space.</li>
               <li>Above all, respect your fellow conference goers in this space so that all of you can find a bit of quiet.</li>
			   <li>Please respect any requests for social distancing or mask wearing in this space.</li>
            </ul>

				<p>
					Code4Lib {{ site.data.conf.year }} will be using Whova as the conference platform. In general, the platform is accessible, but it is missing landmarks and headers on pages. You can <a href="https://github.com/terrill/whova-a11y-fix">install a userscript</a> in your browser (Tampermonkey for Chrome or Greasemonkey for Firefox) that will create landmarks and headers. The userscript is not available for Safari. For assistance, contact <a href="mailto:{{site.data.conf.accessibility-email}}">{{site.data.conf.accessibility-email}}</a>.

			<h2 id="microphones">Microphone Usage</h2>
            <p> The single greatest act you can to do to promote accessibility at Code4Lib {{site.data.conf.year}} is to use the microphone. It doesn't matter if you think you are loud or you can project, you should use the microphone. It benefits everyone:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>When a speaker uses the mic properly, you all hear them better.</li>
               <li>When you ask a question with a mic, the speaker and everyone else hears your question.</li>
               <li>Using the mic ensures everyone livestreaming or watching recorded talks can share the C4L experience.</li>
               <li>Using the mic improves the quality of the live captioning feed.</li>
            </ul>

			<h3>Using a Microphone</h3>
			<p>Generally, the line of the microphone should always point towards your mouth and nose. For a handheld mic, hold it like a candy bar or at a 45 degree angle. Position a podium mic towards you.</p>
