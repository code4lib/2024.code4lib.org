                        Code4Lib {{year}} Conference Diversity Scholarship awardees.
                        Through the generosity of <a href="#sponsors">our
                        sponsors</a> and the Code4lib community we were able to
                        award {{ site.data.scholarship-recipients|size }}
                        scholarships to defray costs associated with attending
                        the conference. We received a large number of applications
                        from highly qualified candidates this year, and it was a
                        humbling experience for the committee to select just
                        {{ site.data.scholarship-recipients|size }} awardees.
                        Congratulations to all Code4Lib scholarship recipients!

                <p>
                    "For me, this truly inclusive conference was a wonderful opportunity to connect with like-minded people and learn about their ideas and great work they do for libraries. I enjoyed and appreciated each and every talk. I connected with librarians and educators who like myself are passionate about promoting equity in tech. Those of us who work in public libraries can use as much help as we can get to help close the digital gap in our communities. The Code4Lib conference provided me with information to add a few of those much-needed skills to my librarian toolbox." <b>-Faezeh Jahan Shiri</b></p>
                <p>
                    "With the support of the Code4Lib Diversity Scholarship, I attended the Code4Lib 2022 Conference. This is the first in-person conference I have attended since the Pandemic. It is indeed exciting to regain the opportunity to meet colleagues in library technology related areas physically from other institutions in the US and other countries. I enjoyed the presentations and discussions and sensed the passion of the Code4Lib community. Through this conference, I also got the chance to know the City of Buffalo and its surrounding attractions. It is a wonderful experience to be part of the Code4Lib 2022." <b>-Grace Liu</b>
