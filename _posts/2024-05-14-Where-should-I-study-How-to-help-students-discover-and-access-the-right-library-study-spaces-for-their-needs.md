title: Where should I study? How to help students discover and access the right library study spaces for their needs.
---
The University of Michigan Library launched their shiny new website in 2018, and while it was an incredibly successful redesign, there were still a few finishing touches missing. Many well-respected universities, including The University of Cambridge and Harvard University, have implemented a searchable and filterable study space finder to help students on campus find places to study that fit their unique needs, and we wanted to make one too! We designed a prototype, using our design system, of our own study space finder based on an evaluation of similar systems. Our team conducted two rounds of user interviews with 25 U-M students to first assess user needs and generate requirements for our design, and then to evaluate our design with an interactive prototype to ensure it would meet the needs of U-M students. When developed and launched in the near future, we expect this system will be a great resource for the U-M community!
