title: Building an open source single-search discovery implementation
---
Lehigh University implemented and user tested a new single-search discovery experience this year, with the goal to simplify our library homepage with a single search box and a (default) results page that brings together resources from all of our public-facing platforms.  We prototyped new functionality and integrations on the VuFind platform, and A/B tested variations with our stakeholders to find a UX that worked.  New features we developed and contributed to the open source community include database recommendations that pull from both the article results and the A-Z list, a suggested librarian based on bibliographic call number ranges, and various UX improvements to VuFind’s existing combined search.  Data sources include open source platforms – FOLIO, ReShare, Islandora – as well as EDS, EBSCO Publication Finder and LibGuides A-Z Databases.  The poster will show the various integrations and UX improvements, including those that came from testing, and what we have planned next.
