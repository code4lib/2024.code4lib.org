title: "Building Effective Library Dashboards in Tableau"
---
The Collection Strategies Division of Columbia University Libraries is using Tableau to develop
a series of dashboards and tools in order to more efficiently and effectively track important
data across collections. These dashboards will provide deeper insight into how library collections
are being utilized and allow staff to make data-informed decisions regarding both existing
collections and potential acquisitions. This talk will discuss the development and design of the
dashboards, workflow implementation, data collection and integration processes, and the various
challenges encountered. It will also include a demonstration of sample dashboards.
