title: "Building a community of practice around library data"
---
Data systems are used throughout libraries to support a variety of needs, including external reporting, decision making for resource allocation and library service design, discovery and access, and traffic monitoring. As libraries increasingly rely on data systems for everyday work across divisions and departments, an increasingly broad group of library staff needs to build skills with using these systems. This presentation will share an early attempt to build a community of practice around library data among staff at a large academic library. The community is supported by a Microsoft Teams space, and biweekly meetings allow the community to meet and discuss topics of interest. Early meetings have focused on specific training topics, including Git/GitHub, SQL, and Python. The presentation will include details about establishing and maintaining the community, as well as early lessons learned.
