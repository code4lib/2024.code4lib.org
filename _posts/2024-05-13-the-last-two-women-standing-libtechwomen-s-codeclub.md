title: "The Last Two Women Standing:  libtechwomen's CodeClub"
---
Late in the year 2014, a call went out on the libtechwomen mailing list proposing the formation of CodeClubs, with the idea that reading other people's code is an essential part of learning to be a good developer.

Two CodeClub groups of 4-5 librarian/library workers each had a weekly virtual meeting, where code, usually from GitHub, was read and analyzed.

 All these years later, two of us, a cataloger and a library software developer, are still meeting weekly over Zoom.  However, not only are we reading code, now we're writing it!

We will describe the work we are doing and discuss the benefits of the CodeClub approach.
