title: Automating File Organization by Leveraging Patterns with Python
---
When faced with organizing a backlog of digital material totaling 144,000 files, it became clear that manual file organization was not a tenable option. Patterns in the files quickly arose and python became a catch-all solution to automating file organization that leveraged those patterns. This poster will highlight the ways in which python can automate various tasks, such as bulk renaming, breaking up larger directories into individual objects, and sorting files into new folders based on a given pattern. It will also address best practices in testing scripts before using them on your data.
