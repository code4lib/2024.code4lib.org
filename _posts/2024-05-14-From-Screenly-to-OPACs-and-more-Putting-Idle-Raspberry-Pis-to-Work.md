The presenter's previous work involved conducting semi-structured interviews with librarians who had utilized maker technologies in their library projects, aiming to gain insight into the potential applications and promote awareness of these possibilities. Subsequently, tutorials and code were created and made publicly available on GitHub, to facilitate the development of similar projects across various library settings. This poster showcases the outcomes of a library case study where these GitHub resources were utilized to implement maker projects within an academic library, aiming to evaluate and enhance the projects for broader adoption.
