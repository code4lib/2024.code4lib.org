title: "One Team, Multiple Initiatives: Project Management and Collaboration Across a Library Team"
---
How does a team balance multiple projects and conflicting priorities? Using the New York Public Library (NYPL)â€™s eReading team as a case study, this presentation will walk attendees through methods of collaboration and resource sharing from a project management perspective. NYPL has developed multiple eReading apps that are used for different sets of patrons: SimplyE, where patrons from participating libraries can check out and read eBooks on their devices, and Open eBooks, where students at Title I schools can access free eBooks. On our eReading team, developers contribute to both projects, while specialized project and product managers lead each initiative. We will discuss best practices and lessons learned through our project management methods.
