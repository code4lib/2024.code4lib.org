title: Build a recomendation engine using AI
---
You may have heard of AI tools like ChatGPT and OpenAI, but have you put them to work for your library? This workshop is a gentle introduction to AI by building a recommendation system for library materials.

Our existing online search has helped our users find materials, but they've really only been doing text matching. Now, we can use large language models to do text analysis and AI tools to build recommendations in a different way. In this workshop you can create a simple application for helping patrons find materials they are interested in, but didn't know existed. Along the way we'll build skills to implement similarity searches for other data sets and learn about some useful tools for working with large language models.
