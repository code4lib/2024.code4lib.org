title: "The Compassion of DevOps"
---
A strong DevOps culture helps teams deliver high quality products on predictable schedules. But in my experience, the strongest DevOps culture is the one that recognizes suffering and offers compassion to a technology workforce that is often over tasked and under resourced. This talk will discuss DevOps best practices, but also how the lack of these practices can take a toll on our bodies and spirits, in ways that are not often acknowledged.
