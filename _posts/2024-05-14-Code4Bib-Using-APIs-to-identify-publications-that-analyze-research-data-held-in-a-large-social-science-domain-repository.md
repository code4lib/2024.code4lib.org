title: Code4Bib&#58; Using APIs to identify publications that analyze research data held in a large social science domain repository
---
The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) maintains the ICPSR Bibliography of Data-related Literature. The Bibliography, created in 1999, catalogs the usage of ICPSR data in research and hosts over 110,000 citations. The Bibliography is continually updated by a group of five information professionals who identify instances of ICPSR data usage in various publications. The process of discovering possible publications for inclusion in the Bibliography is quite labor-intensive due to the lack of data citation consistency. In an effort to increase discovery and decrease human intervention in searching, the Bibliography team has incorporated the use of indexer APIs to mine the literature for ICPSR data use. This poster will outline the challenges in identifying data usage in the literature, demonstrate the API code and workflow, and discuss possibilities for future enhancements to automated methods of finding data-related publications.
