title: Designing an open-source application to record Library Door Traffic Counter
---
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the concept of "social distancing guidelines" emerged as a crucial measure to mitigate the spread of the virus. These guidelines are particularly challenging to uphold in high-traffic areas such as university libraries, which experience significant footfall during academic semesters. To address this challenge, library officials have turned to technology, including door traffic count applications, to obtain real-time data on patron capacity. This allows them to effectively monitor and manage social distancing measures within the library premises, ensuring the safety of patrons. Although numerous vendor-based solutions exist to address this requirement, this poster focuses on an open-source application designed to monitor real-time door traffic counts at the Oklahoma State University Library.
