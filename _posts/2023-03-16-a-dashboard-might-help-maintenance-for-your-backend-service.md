title: "A Dashboard Might Help Maintenance for Your Backend Service"
---
We have a complex backend API service with a team responsible for maintenance.  Different errors occur in this service and even though there is documentation, the team struggles to address the problems due to service complexity.  This is an organizational vulnerability smell.  With some team brainstorming, the idea of a dashboard surfaced – something to show the current health status of the service … and a way to associate specific current problems with the appropriate documentation and tools to address said problems.  A dashboard prototype surfaced additional desires for information demand, from “tell me about this object” to “I want stats for the last 6 months.”  An interesting bonus:  the initial implementation of the dashboard surfaced a data problem not caught at runtime or by our regularly run audits.
