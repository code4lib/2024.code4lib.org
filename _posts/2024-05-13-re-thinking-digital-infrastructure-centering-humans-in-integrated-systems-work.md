title: "[Re]Thinking Digital Infrastructure: Centering Humans in Integrated Systems Work"
---
In this talk, librarians and archivists from an academic library will discuss establishing and cultivating a Digital Infrastructure Working Group (DIWG). The DIWG was born out of a need to create interoperability between metadata, preservation, discovery, and access systems for archival materials, and demanded a radical rethinking of prior organizational approaches to digital asset curation, including leveraging available APIs and vendor contracted system development. Learn how team members approached technological work by centering each otherâ€™s well-being and intentionally making visible the often-invisible human labor invested in developing and maintaining digital infrastructure. We will share how the DIWG challenged organizational silos, established cross-departmental communication and workflows, and cultivated a climate of professional support and human-centered care in a pandemic and post-pandemic workplace. Key takeaways include recommendations made to library administration for digital infrastructure curation moving forward.
