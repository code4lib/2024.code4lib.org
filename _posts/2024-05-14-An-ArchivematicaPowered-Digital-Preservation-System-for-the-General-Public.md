title: An Archivematica-Powered Digital Preservation System for the General Public
---
The Permanent Legacy Foundation provides endowment-backed archival cloud storage directly to private individuals and small organizations. We are currently in the process of rebuilding our file processing pipeline. To do so, we will leverage a fully automated Archivematica pipeline in our backend to both improve performance and better adhere to archival best practices. We are exploring different deployment approaches for the best balance of cost, performance, maintainability, and scalability. This poster will cover how we chose Archivematica, our design for integrating it into our processing pipeline, how we might iterate on that design in the future, challenges that have arisen during implementation, and how we plan to present the institutional-grade preservation available through Archivematica to an audience of mostly non-specialist users.
