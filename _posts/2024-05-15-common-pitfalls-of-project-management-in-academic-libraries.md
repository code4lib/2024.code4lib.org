title: "Common Pitfalls of Project Management In Academic Libraries"
---
Few libraries have a project management office that can carry out their projects in a systematic matter.  Developers, supervisors and technicians are often called upon to conduct their own project management while also doing much of the project work themselves.  In this presentation I will cherry-pick the choicest bits of wisdom from the PMBOK Guide and tailor them for library scenarios where work units are divided into functional departments and project managers serve multiple roles.  I will structure this talk around common issues that arise with library projects and show where project management best practices can be applied to remedy those issues.  Attendees will gain knowledge for successfully planning projects and for controlling work over the course of a project.   For this presentation I will be drawing on the PMI 99-001 standards for project management as well as mixing in a few of my own insights.
