title: "Change is Afoot: What WCAG2.2, WCAG3, ..., WCAG9000? Mean for Libraries"
---
As of October 2023, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) were officially updated to version 2.2. This new W3C recommendation introduces nine new success criteria (ranging from A to AAA) and a handful edits to existing criteria. This talk will discuss the potential implications of WCAG 2.2 for our library web content and provide potential fixes if necessary. Moreover, I will discuss how new WCAG recommendations are crafted, including some preliminary discussion and cautions regarding WCAG3 and the future of the web accessibility.
