title: "Everything could have been different: why computers are like that"
---
There are certain things we take for granted: bytes have eight bits, the internet uses packets. But these are decisions made by humans when other alternatives were on the table. In this talk, Iâ€™ll tell stories of some papers that were pivot points in the history of computing. How is the internet a response to nuclear war? How did a neuropsychologist and a tragic genius dream up neural nets? There will be an absolute banger of a bibliography for you to continue learning with.
