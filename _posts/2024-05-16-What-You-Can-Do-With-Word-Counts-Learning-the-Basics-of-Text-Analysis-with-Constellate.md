title: What You Can Do With Word Counts&#58; Learning the Basics of Text Analysis with Constellate
---
Constellate offers a comprehensive and easily accessible program that helps your community develop text analysis and data mining competencies, along with related skills, through multiple modes of learning and hands-on application with tens of millions of texts from JSTOR, Portico, and other open source providers. In this workshop, Nathan Kelber (Constellate Education Manager) and Matt Lincoln (Senior Software Engineer) will introduce Constellate and discuss its teaching and learning focus. We will then preview upcoming new features, including new tools for doing deep dives into individual documents. In the latter half of the session we will demonstrate some text analysis with Python in the Constellate Lab and discuss how to use your own Jupyter notebooks.
