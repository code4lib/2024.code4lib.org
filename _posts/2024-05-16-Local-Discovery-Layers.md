title: Local Discovery Layers
---
Some libraries have built their own discovery layers to interface with their Integrated Library System (ILS), Library Management System (LMS), and/or Library Services Platform (LSP). If you count yourself among them, let’s get together and talk about what we’ve learned about using local search indexes (i.e., Solr), using the APIs supplied by the ILS/LMS/LSP vendors, connecting to other sources of data, working with large sets of library data, and building usable and accessible front ends. This half-day session will be organized unconference-style. While we have some possible topics to start the conversation, attendees will decide on topics together and then discuss as a group or form breakouts for niche conversations. We’ll bring summaries of discussions back to the whole group and make plans for future interactions and action as appropriate.

Possible topics as seeds for discussion include:

- What new features or modifications have you been exploring?
- What are the particular pain points, and what could we collectively do to encourage vendors to help solve them?
- What role do UX and Accessibility play in your application development?

Who should join this workshop? Application developers, front-end developers, UI/UX designers, and project managers or other roles in building, planning, or maintaining these systems.
