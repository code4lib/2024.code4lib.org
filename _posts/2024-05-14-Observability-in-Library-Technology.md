title: Observability in Library Technology
---
Observability allows you to observe what's happening inside of your code and ask questions of it. Within the lens of library technology, observability practices can apply to a variety of systems from library application development to server environments.

Observability requires instrumentation to emit data signals, such as traces, logs, and metrics. That data can then be used to troubleshoot, address issues, transfer knowledge within and across team boundaries, and support stakeholders. Thus, Observability can transform both technical and socio-technical systems.

This poster covers core observability concepts and illustrates use cases within library technology. In highlighting sustainable practices that can improve development speed and reduce toil, the goal is to encourage dialog around creating a better socio-technical development experience.
