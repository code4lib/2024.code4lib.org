title: "International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) infrastructure redesign at Harvard Library"
---
The Library Technology Services (LTS) team at Harvard University has completed designing, building, and implementing the next-generation image delivery infrastructure for the Harvard Library. This infrastructure is largely based on standards and technologies compatible with the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF). LTS maintains the IIIF infrastructure for delivering images and metadata to Harvard Library platforms such as HOLLIS (the Harvard Library catalog) and Harvard Digital Collections (public access to more than 6 million objects). The IIIF environment is also used by the Harvard Art Museums, HUIT Academic Technology (with integration into Canvas) and Vice Provost for Advances in Learning (VPAL), and is considered critical university-wide infrastructure for teaching and research.  Members of LTS will host a series of presentations and demonstrations to showcase the recent work on the IIIF implementation project. Engineers will explain the architecture principles guiding the designs and show the technical plans and system architecture diagrams. A full walkthrough of the entire asset ingest and delivery workflow will be shown with recorded demos.
