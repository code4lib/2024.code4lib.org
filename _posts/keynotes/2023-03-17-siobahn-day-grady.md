Dr. Siobahn Grady is an Assistant Professor of Library and Information Sciences and the director
of the [Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence and Equity Research
(LAIER)](https://www.nccu.edu/slis/laboratory-artificial-intelligence-and-equity-research-laier)
at North Carolina Central University, the only ALA-Accredited Library School at an HBCU
(Historically Black College or University). Dr. Grady's research is focused on using machine
learning to identify sources of misinformation on social media, and on improving fault detection in
autonomous vehicles. Dr. Grady is an IF/THEN Ambassador for the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, a program which seeks to bring more women and minorities into hard
sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics. Dr. Grady was the first woman to graduate with
a computer science Ph.D. from N.C. A&T State University, and through her teaching, research,
philanthropy and public speaking she is a passionate supporter of HBCUs and the students they
serve. Code4Lib would benefit from learning about her work at LAIER and about her vision for
minority girls' and women's futures in technology fields.
