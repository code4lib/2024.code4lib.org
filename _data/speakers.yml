  bio: "Libby Hemphill (Associate Professor, University of Michigan School of Information, Research Associate Professor, U-M Institute for Social Research, and Director, ICPSR’s Resource Center for Minority Data and founding Director, ICPSR’s Social Media Archive) studies social computing and digital curation. Her research on social computing has demonstrated the impact of social media on Congressional behavior, has shown how social media platforms shape public discourse in virtual and IRL public spaces, and has developed a natural language processing approach to detecting and intervening to de-escalate abusive online behavior. Her research in digital curation has studied the responsible and ethical use and reuse of datasets in research, the design of infrastructure and technology to support research data archives, the importance of curation for improving the FAIRness of social media and other data, and the impact of data reuse. Her practice of digital curation at ICPSR has made available transformative data such as TransPop, the first national probability sample of transgender individuals in the United States, and SOMAR, a platform for transparent, reproducible preservation and ethical access to social media data. She has worked with the Anti-Defamation League to understand and respond to online hate, and she has created a post-baccalaureate program to diversify the pipeline of students engaged in computational social science research. She is a transformative scholar who has used her expertise and position to democratize data access."

  name: Dr. Patricia Garcia
  last: Garcia
  institution: University of Michigan School of Information
  bio: "Dr. Patricia Garcia conducts qualitative research on the complex relationship between race, gender, technology, and justice. She is currently partnering with public libraries to study how a computational justice program model can support girls of color (ages 13-16) develop agentic computing identities. This research involves the design of computing education programs that support girls of color in situating their computing identities within broader self-concepts and in ways that highlight how the intersections of race and gender can function as sources of power, rather than simply sites of marginalization. Her other related work examines how harmful data practices perpetuate structural inequities along racialized and gendered lines, and she collaborates with data practitioners to imagine and enact more equitable data futures. Her work spans the fields of computing education, learning sciences, youth studies, and critical data studies."
