    of North Texas Libraries. She has applied her skills in research methods, statistical
    analysis, and data management to the broad evaluation of library collections.

  bio: Libby Hemphill (Associate Professor, University of Michigan School of Information,
    Research Associate Professor, U-M Institute for Social Research, and Director,
    ICPSR’s Resource Center for Minority Data and founding Director, ICPSR’s Social
    Media Archive) studies social computing and digital curation. Her research on
    social computing has demonstrated the impact of social media on Congressional
    behavior, has shown how social media platforms shape public discourse in virtual
    and IRL public spaces, and has developed a natural language processing approach
    to detecting and intervening to de-escalate abusive online behavior. Her research
    in digital curation has studied the responsible and ethical use and reuse of datasets
    in research, the design of infrastructure and technology to support research data
    archives, the importance of curation for improving the FAIRness of social media
    and other data, and the impact of data reuse. Her practice of digital curation
    at ICPSR has made available transformative data such as TransPop, the first national
    probability sample of transgender individuals in the United States, and SOMAR,
    a platform for transparent, reproducible preservation and ethical access to social
    media data. She has worked with the Anti-Defamation League to understand and respond
    to online hate, and she has created a post-baccalaureate program to diversify
    the pipeline of students engaged in computational social science research. She
    is a transformative scholar who has used her expertise and position to democratize
    data access.

  institution: University of Michigan School of Information
  bio: Dr. Patricia Garcia conducts qualitative research on the complex relationship
    between race, gender, technology, and justice. She is currently partnering with
    public libraries to study how a computational justice program model can support
    girls of color (ages 13-16) develop agentic computing identities. This research
    involves the design of computing education programs that support girls of color
    in situating their computing identities within broader self-concepts and in ways
    that highlight how the intersections of race and gender can function as sources
    of power, rather than simply sites of marginalization. Her other related work
    examines how harmful data practices perpetuate structural inequities along racialized
    and gendered lines, and she collaborates with data practitioners to imagine and
    enact more equitable data futures. Her work spans the fields of computing education,
    learning sciences, youth studies, and critical data studies.
